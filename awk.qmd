# awk2 {.unnumbered}

awk is scripting language named after its developers (Aho, Weinberger, and Kernighan) ([usage](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/awk-command-unixlinux-examples/))

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Things to know about awk:

-   awk refers to columns as field, such as in the variables for number of fields (`NF`), input field separator (`FS`), and output field separator (`OFS`).

-   awk refers to rows as records, such as in the variables for record number (`NR`), input record separator (`RS`), and output record separator (`ORS`).

-   By default, awk recognizes a space or tab as a field separator. If your input file has field separators other than a space or a tab, you need to specify it using the `-F` flag.

-   awk has several built-in variables that can be used when writing code:

    -   `$1` = field 1 (\$2 = field 2, \$3 = field 3, ...)

    -   `$0` = entire record

    -   `NF` = number of fields

    -   `NR` = number of records

    -   `FS` = input field separator; default is white space (i.e. space and tab)

    -   `OFS` = output field separator; default is single space

    -   `RS` = input record separator; default is new line

    -   `ORS` = output record separator; default is new line

    -   `[0-9]` = any number

Below are examples of how the awk command can be used to achieve lots of desired outcomes when processing data files.

```{r}

```

```{bash}
cat data.txt # View data.txt
```

Printing all of the fields (synonymous with `awk '{print $0}' data.txt`)

```{bash}
awk '{print}' data.txt
```

Print a particular field (e.g. field 1)

```{bash}
awk '{print $1}' data.txt
```

If input file uses a comma (`,`) as a field separator instead of space or tab, set input field separator as (`,`) (synonymous with `awk '{ FS = "," } ; {print $1}' data.csv`).

> Try leaving out the `-F,` and see what happens.

```{bash}
cat data.csv # View comma separated file (.csv)
```

```{bash}
awk -F, '{print $1}' data.csv
```

Print multiple fields (e.g. field 1 and 3)

```{bash}
awk '{print $1,$3}' data.txt
```

Print the last field

```{bash}
awk '{print $NF}' data.txt
```

Print all records after the first record (synonymous with `awk 'NR!=1 {print}' /path/to/file`)

```{bash}
awk 'NR>1 {print}' data.txt
```

Print a particular record (e.g. record 3)

```{bash}
awk 'NR==3 {print}' data.txt
```

Print all records except for a particular record (e.g. not record 3)

```{bash}
awk 'NR!=3 {print}' data.txt
```

Print a range of records (e.g. records 2 to 3)

```{bash}
awk 'NR==2, NR==3 {print}' data.txt
```

Print records with fewer than a certain number of fields (e.g. fewer than 4 fields)

```{bash}
cat data2.txt # View data2.txt
```

```{bash}
awk 'NF<4 {print}' data2.txt
```

Print records containing a certain string anywhere in record (e.g. `abc`)

```{bash}
cat data3.txt
```

```{bash}
awk '/abc/ {print}' data3.txt
```

Print records starting with a certain string (e.g. `abc`)

```{bash}
awk '/^abc/ {print}' data3.txt
```

Print records ending with a certain string (e.g. `abc`) \>One caveat between macOS and Windows (even when using wsl) is that the line ending character in macOS (i.e. unix) is `\n` while the line ending character in Windows is `\r\n`. This means that a text file made on a Mac may have a different line ending character than Windows recognizes (and vice versa). To avoid this problem...

```{bash}
awk '/abc$/ {print}' data3.txt
```

Print records that don't contain a certain string anywhere in record (e.g. `abc`)

```{bash}
awk '!/abc/ {print}' data3.txt
```

Print records that don't start with a certain string (e.g. `abc`)

```{bash}
awk '!/^abc/ {print}' data3.txt
```

Print records that don't end with a certain string (e.g. `abc`)

```{bash}
awk '!/abc$/ {print}' data3.txt
```

Print records where a particular field contains a string (e.g. `abc` in field 1)

```{bash}
awk '$1 ~ /abc/ {print}' data3.txt
```

Print records where a particular field starts with a string (e.g. `abc` in field 1)

```{bash}
awk '$1 ~ /^abc/ {print}' data3.txt
```

Print records where a particular field ends with a string (e.g. `abc` in field 4)

```{bash}
awk '$4 ~ /abc$/ {print}' data3.txt
```

Print records where a particular field starts with any number (e.g. field 1)

```{bash}
cat data4.txt
```

```{bash}
awk '$1 ~ /^[0-9]/ {print}' data4.txt
```

Print records where a particular field ends with any number (e.g. field 1)

```{bash}
awk '$1 ~ /[0-9]$/ {print}' data4.txt
```

Ignore case when looking for records containing a string (e.g. `abc`)

```{bash}
awk 'tolower($0) ~ /abc/ {print}' data4.txt
```

Print records that contain a certain value in a particular field (e.g. the number 3210 in field 2)

```{bash}
cat data.txt
```

```{bash}
awk '$2==3210 {print}' data.txt
```

Print records that do not contain a certain value in a particular field (e.g. not the number 10 in field 2)

```{bash}
awk '$2!=3210 {print}' data.txt
```

Print records that contain a value greater than a certain value in a particular field (e.g. \>2354 in field 2)

```{bash}
awk '$2>2354 {print}' data.txt
```

Print records that contain a value less than a certain value in a particular field (e.g. \<2354 in field 2)

```{bash}
awk '$2<2354 {print}' data.txt
```

Print records that contain a value less than or equal to a certain value in a particular field (e.g. \<2354 in field 2)

```{bash}
awk '$2<=2354 {print}' data.txt
```

Sum values in a field (e.g. field 2)

```{bash}
awk '{sum+=$2;} END{print sum;}' data.txt
```

Remember to add `NR>1` if your file has a header in case the headers are numeric

```{bash}
awk 'NR>1 {sum+=$2;} END{print sum;}' data.txt
```

Remove blank lines

```{bash}
cat data5.txt
```

```{bash}
awk 'NF' data5.txt
```

Print the record number at beginning of record

```{bash}
awk '{print NR,$0}' data.txt
```
