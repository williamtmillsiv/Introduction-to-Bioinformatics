# awk {.unnumbered}

awk is scripting language named after its developers (Aho, Weinberger, and Kernighan)

Here is some vocabulary commonly used by awk:

-   Field = column

-   Record = line (i.e. row)

awk has several built-in variables that can be used in its code:

-   `$1` = field 1 (\$2 = field 2, \$3 = field 3, ...)

-   `$0` = entire record

-   `NF` = number of fields

-   `NR` = number of records

-   `FS` = input field separator; default is white space (i.e. space and tab)

-   `OFS` = output field separator; default is single space

-   `RS` = input record separator; default is new line

-   `ORS` = output record separator; default is new line

-   `[0-9]` = any number
