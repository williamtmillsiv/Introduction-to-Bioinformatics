If your input file has field separators other than a space or a tab, you need to specify it using the `-F` flag.\n\n-   awk has several built-in variables that can be used when writing code:\n\n    -   `$1` = field 1 (\\$2 = field 2, \\$3 = field 3, ...)\n\n    -   `$0` = entire record\n\n    -   `NF` = number of fields\n\n    -   `NR` = number of records\n\n    -   `FS` = input field separator; default is white space (i.e. space and tab)\n\n    -   `OFS` = output field separator; default is single space\n\n    -   `RS` = input record separator; default is new line\n\n    -   `ORS` = output record separator; default is new line\n\n    -   `[0-9]` = any number\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEach of the code examples shown below is preceded by viewing the input file to better visualize what each line of code is doing. The `$` at the beginning of each line of code represents the end of prompt you see in your command line. If you'd like to run the code in these examples, simply copy everything after the `$` into your command line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\ncat data.txt\n```\n\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nGeneNames Sample1 Sample2 Sample3\nGeneX 321 5678  689\nGeneY 2354  6700  987\nGeneZ 2315  7890  123\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a test R code block\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Test R code\ndim(cars)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 50  2\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n",
