# Getting Started {.unnumbered}

In order to perform most bioinformatic analyses, users will need access to a Unix or Unix-like operating system. Windows users will need to install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) while Mac users just need access to the Terminal application. Below are instructions for accessing a Unix or Unix-like command line for Windows and Mac users.

## Windows (using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL))

1.  Open the Windows Terminal application
2.  Run (i.e. type in) `wsl --install` (and click enter)
3.  Restart your device
4.  Open Windows Terminal
5.  Run `wsl`
6.  By default this should open the distribution (Ubuntu by default)

-   If this doesn't work, you may need to run `wsl.exe --install -d Ubuntu` and may need to restart your computer again

-   Enter a username and password (does not need to match your computer login)

    -   You wonâ€™t see what you type in appear on the screen, just hit enter when you are done

-   To log out of the distribution, run `exit`

-   Every time you open Windows Terminal, you need to run `wsl` to turn on Windows Subsystem for Linux

## Mac (using Terminal)

1.  Open Terminal (Applications \> Utilities \> Terminal)
