# Command Line Tips {.unnumbered}

-   Press ‘tab’ button to autofill

-   Depending on shell, hitting tab once (zsh) or twice (bash) will display options if multiple exist

-   Press ‘up’ arrow to recall last command

-   ‘Control + A’ to move to beginning of line

-   ‘Control + E’ to move to end of line

-   ‘Control + C’ to end (i.e. kill) command

-   ‘Control + Z’ to exit manual

-   Avoid using spaces when naming files or folders

-   Beware curly (i.e. smart) quotes `‘`, be sure to use straight quotes `'`. Curly quotes usually come from text editors like Microsoft Word and don't work when coding. To ensure you are using straight quotes, write code in a plain-text editor like TextEdit (Mac) or Notepad (Windows) and turn off spelling and grammar checking.
