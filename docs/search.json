    "text": "Introduction\nBioinformatics, as it pertains to this book, is the usage of computational tools to process biological data. As science has progressed, the datasets produced during scientific experiments have become larger and larger and therefore the ability to glean insights from the data has become less and less straightforward. The growing complexity and size of scientific data has necessitated an increased reliance on computational tools for storing, analyzing, and visualizing data. The past 20 years of scientific research since the complete sequencing of the human genome has seen vast increases in the types of data generated and the number of tools used to process it. Several tools that will be discussed throughout this book have emerged as vital resources for processing particular types of biological data. This book will explore what types of biological data are out there, what tools are available to process it, and how you can begin processing data on your own computer. Even though the main emphasis of this book will be helping readers understand how to process sequencing data, many of the ideas and skills learned will be useful for dealing with other forms of biological data."

I am now an Assistant Professor of Biochemistry/Bioinformatics at Mount St. Mary’s University (Emmitsburg, MD). I began working in bioinformatics during graduate school where I developed pipelines for processing novel types of sequencing data. While my formal training was in chemistry and biology, my experience in bioinformatics was largely self taught. I now strive to share what I’ve learned with scientists looking to step into bioinformatics for the first time.\n\n\n \n\n\nPlease contribute to this book by submitting your feedback: https://github.com/williamtmills/Introduction-to-Bioinformatics\nThis is a Quarto book.

    "text": "1.1 Common terms to understand\nIn this book, and throughout your time engaged with bioinformatics, you will encounter many terms that may not be in your everyday lexicon but will become invaluable to successful computing. While some terms may describe new ideas to you, others may be synonyms for terms you are more familiar with but are necessary to use when dealing with computers. Though not an exhaustive list, below are several of the terms you may encounter in bioinformatics:\ncode: a group of text, when executed, that performs a computational task\ndirectory: a place where files are stored; synonymous with “folder”\nexecute:\n(a) to run a line of code or script\n(b) in reference to privileges, the ability to run a script\nread:\n(a) a single sequence letters corresponding to nucleotide bases of DNA or RNA\n(b) in references to privileges, the ability to open and view a file or directory\nscript: a file that contains multiple lines of code that collectively perform a computational task\nwrite: in references to privileges, to add to a file or directory"

    "section": "3.1 Doing bioinformatics well",
    "text": "3.1 Doing bioinformatics well\nOver the course of your scientific career using bioinformatics, you will write thousands of lines of codes and generate possible hundreds of different scripts. When compared to canonical experiments where researchers are able to complete one experiment every few days, bioinformatics “experiments” can be executed in minutes, meaning you can complete dozens or even hundreds of experiments in a week. This necessitates a very high degree of organization and note taking to keep track of all your protocols, data, and analyses. Before we even write our first line of code, there are a few tips that can help us start on the right foot:\n\nStay organized. While you may have experience making documents and folders on your computer, doing bioinformatics requires taking this practice to the next level. You should maintain a very organized file structure that allows you to easily retrieve files and understand how they were generated. This could involve having folders (often called “directories” in bioinformatics) inside of folders and README files that explain when how the files in that folder were generated. You need to properly label folders and files with version IDs more easily understand when the files were generated and using which protocols.\nTake good notes. When you begin writing code and eventually entire scripts, you will find it easier to keep writing code than annotating your script. Resist this urge. Just as you would take notes in your lab notebook during the course of an experiment at the bench, you should always take notes on what you are trying to accomplish, what difficulties or errors you experience along the way, and how you solved the problems and reached your final conclusion. Taking good notes will save you countless hours of having to go back and understand what a particular line of code is doing or trying to solve a previously-solved issue.\nOutput run info."
