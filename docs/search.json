Please excuse any disorganization or incomplete pages.\nThis book will explore what types of biological data are out there, what tools are available to process them, and how you can begin processing data on your own computer. Even though the main emphasis of this book will be helping readers understand how to process sequencing data, many of the ideas and skills learned will be useful for dealing with other forms of biological data.",

I am now an Assistant Professor of Biology at Mount St. Mary’s University (Emmitsburg, MD). I began working in bioinformatics during graduate school where I developed pipelines for processing novel types of sequencing data. While my formal training was in chemistry and biology, my experience in bioinformatics was largely self taught. I now strive to share what I’ve learned with scientists looking to step into bioinformatics for the first time.\n\n\n \n\n\nPlease contribute to this book by submitting your feedback: https://github.com/williamtmills/Introduction-to-Bioinformatics\nThis is a Quarto book.
